## üÜï What's New in v1.2.0

### üéØ Smart Installation Script (v1.2.0)

**NEW:** Super-simple 3-step installation for any project!

**What's new:**
- ü§ñ **Smart script** `init-project.sh` - one command to rule them all
- üì¶ **Pre-packaged templates** in .zip - no git cloning needed
- üîç **Auto-detection** - script knows if it's new or legacy project
- ‚úÖ **Zero configuration** for new projects - just run and code!

**Before (5 steps, error-prone):**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexeykrol/claude-code-starter.git
cd claude-code-starter
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
cp -r ../claude-code-starter/Init/* .
cp -r ../claude-code-starter/Init/.claude .  # Easy to forget!
```

**After (1 step):**
```bash
bash init-project.sh  # Done!
```

### üßπ Documentation Deduplication (v1.2.0)

**MAJOR:** Framework documentation refactored to eliminate duplications!

**Impact:**
- üìâ 90% reduction in duplicated content (~500 lines eliminated)
- üìñ Clear **Single Source of Truth** for each concept

## üÜï Previous Updates

### üìÇ Migration Exclusion System (v1.1.3)

**NEW:** `.migrationignore` file support for excluding non-project files from migration!

**Key features:**
- üìù Gitignore-style syntax for exclusion patterns
- ü§ñ AI auto-detection of non-meta files (articles, meeting notes, research)
- üí¨ Interactive confirmation before creating .migrationignore
- üìä Detailed reporting of excluded files in MIGRATION_REPORT.md
- ‚úÖ Excluded files remain in place (not migrated, not archived)

**Problem solved:** Legacy projects often contain reference materials that shouldn't be migrated as project documentation.

**Before:** All files processed ‚Üí false conflicts ‚Üí manual cleanup
**After:** Create .migrationignore ‚Üí only project docs processed ‚Üí clean migration

### ü§ñ Interactive Conflict Resolution (v1.1.2)

**NEW:** AI-guided conflict resolution makes migration effortless!

**`/migrate-resolve`** command:
- üéØ Analyzes each conflict and proposes smart merge solution
- üí¨ Interactive: [A]uto-resolve / [M]anual / [S]kip / [Q]uit
- üõ°Ô∏è Safe: timestamped backups, detailed logging
- üìù Creates CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md with all actions

**Before:** "Too many conflicts, don't know where to start" ‚Üí frustration
**After:** `/migrate-resolve` ‚Üí AI shows exactly what to do ‚Üí [A] to accept ‚Üí done!

### üîÑ Migration System (v1.1.0-1.1.1)

The framework supports **automatic migration of legacy projects**!

**Commands:**
- **`/migrate`** - automatic migration of documentation from legacy project
- **`/migrate-resolve`** - interactive AI-guided conflict resolution ‚≠ê **NEW**
- **`/migrate-finalize`** - finalization after review
- **`/migrate-rollback`** - rollback at any stage

**Features:**
- **Two-stage process with pause** for safety
- **Automatic conflict detection** (critical/medium/low priority)
- **Legacy files archiving** (not deletion)
- **Detailed reports** (MIGRATION_REPORT.md, CONFLICTS.md)

**Documentation:**
- Full guide: [`init_eng/MIGRATION.md`](init_eng/MIGRATION.md) (900+ lines)
- See section [üîÑ Migrating Existing Projects](#-migrating-existing-projects) below

**Also:**
- `/migrate` now for project migration
- `/db-migrate` for database migrations (renamed)

## üéØ What is this?

**Claude Code Starter** is a ready-to-use meta-documentation framework that transforms chaotic AI-assisted development into a structured and efficient process.

### The Problem

When working with Claude Code or other AI agents:
- üî• AI doesn't understand project context ‚Üí makes wrong architectural decisions
- üí∏ Loads entire project into context ‚Üí wastes tokens and money
- üîÑ You explain the same things repeatedly ‚Üí waste time
- üé≤ Unpredictable results ‚Üí no single source of truth
- üö´ Security issues ‚Üí AI doesn't know the rules

### The Solution

The framework provides **11 ready-made documentation templates** that:
- ‚úÖ **Auto-load** into Claude Code context (via `CLAUDE.md`)
- ‚úÖ **Save tokens** through modular architecture
- ‚úÖ **Single source of truth** for AI and team
- ‚úÖ **Built-in security** (SECURITY.md)
- ‚úÖ **Slash commands** for automation (/commit, /pr, /migrate, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Standardized processes** via Makefile

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

> **New in v1.2.0:** Super-simple installation with smart script! Just 3 steps.

### 1. Download Files

Download from [Releases](https://github.com/alexeykrol/claude-code-starter/releases):
- **`init-starter.zip`** - Russian templates
- **`init-starter-en.zip`** - English templates
- **`init-project.sh`** - Smart installation script

### 2. Copy to Your Project

Copy both files to your project folder:
- **New project:** Create a folder and copy there
- **Existing project:** Copy to project root

```bash
# Example for new project
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
# Copy init-starter.zip and init-project.sh here
```

### 3. Run Installation

Open terminal **IN YOUR PROJECT FOLDER** and run:

```bash
bash init-project.sh
```

**That's it!** The script will:
- ‚úÖ Ask confirmation you're in the right folder
- ‚úÖ Extract templates
- ‚úÖ Detect if it's a new or existing project
- ‚úÖ **New project:** Auto-install templates
- ‚úÖ **Legacy project:** Prepare for migration

### 4. Next Steps

**For NEW projects:**
```bash
# Rename README template
mv README-TEMPLATE.md README.md

# Fill in project details
code PROJECT_INTAKE.md

# Launch Claude Code
claude

# Start dialogue
"Read PROJECT_INTAKE.md and ask all clarifying questions"
```

**For LEGACY projects:**
```bash
# (Optional) Create .migrationignore to exclude files
cp init_eng/.migrationignore.example .migrationignore

# Launch Claude Code
claude

# Run migration
/migrate
```

---

## üîÑ Migrating Existing Projects

> **Already have a project with legacy documentation?** Use automatic migration!

### When You Need Migration

If you have:
- ‚úÖ Existing project with code
- ‚úÖ Scattered documentation (README, docs/, notes/, TODO, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Want to structure into unified framework

### Quick Start Migration

> **New in v1.2.0:** Use the smart installation script!

```bash
# 1. Download init-starter-en.zip and init-project.sh
# 2. Copy both to your existing project folder
cd your-existing-project

# 3. Run installation script
bash init-project.sh --lang=en

# Script will detect existing project and prepare for migration!

# 4. (Optional) Create .migrationignore to exclude files
cp init_eng/.migrationignore.example .migrationignore
# Edit to exclude reference articles, meeting notes, research docs, etc.

# 5. Launch Claude Code
claude

# 6. Run automatic migration
/migrate
```

### Excluding Files from Migration (Optional)

**Problem:** Your project may have reference articles, meeting notes, or research documents that are NOT project meta-documentation.

**Solution:** Create `.migrationignore` (similar to `.gitignore`):

```bash
# Copy example and customize
cp init_eng/.migrationignore.example .migrationignore
```

**What to exclude:**
- Reference articles (docs/articles/, docs/references/)
- Meeting notes (notes/meeting-*.md)
- Temporary notes (notes/temp*.md)
- Research documents (research/)
- Old versions (old/, archive/)
- Binary files (*.pdf, *.docx)

**Result:**
- Excluded files stay in original location (not migrated, not archived)
- MIGRATION_REPORT.md shows what was excluded
- AI can auto-detect and suggest exclusions during `/migrate`

### Two-Stage Process with Pause

**Stage 1: Analysis and Transfer (automatic)**
- Scans all your meta-files
- Transfers information to init_eng/ structure
- Archives legacy files
- Creates report and conflict list
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Pauses for your review**

**Pause: Your Review**
- Read MIGRATION_REPORT.md
- Resolve conflicts with `/migrate-resolve` (interactive AI-guided process)
- Check init_eng/ files
- Fill gaps

**Stage 2: Finalization (on command)**
```bash
/migrate-finalize
```
- Completes migration
- Creates git commit
- init_eng/ becomes single source of truth

### Learn More

Full migration guide: `init_eng/MIGRATION.md`

**What Migrates Automatically:**
- `docs/README.md` ‚Üí `PROJECT_INTAKE.md`
- `docs/architecture.md` ‚Üí `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `security.md` ‚Üí `SECURITY.md`
- `TODO.md` ‚Üí `BACKLOG.md`
- And all other meta-files

**Safety:**
- All legacy files archived (not deleted)
- Two-stage process with pause for review
- `/migrate-rollback` - automatic rollback at any stage

## üß© Philosophy: Modular Architecture

### Why modules are critical for AI work?

**Monolithic approach problem:**
```
Claude loads entire project (5000 lines) ‚Üí
Wastes tokens reading everything ‚Üí
Expensive and slow ‚Üí
May get confused in large context
```

**Solution through modules:**
```
Claude loads only needed module (200 lines) ‚Üí
Fewer tokens ‚Üí
Faster and cheaper ‚Üí
Better understanding of task
```

### Modularity Principle

**Application = Set of small LEGO blocks**

Each module:
- Solves **one narrow task**
- Has **clear input and output**
- Can be **tested separately**
- **Doesn't depend** on other modules

Read more in `Init/ARCHITECTURE.md` (section "Module Architecture")

## üéì How to Work with the Framework

### Stage 1: Project Initialization

1. **Copy templates** from `Init/` to your project
2. **Fill PROJECT_INTAKE.md** - this is the foundation
3. **Read SECURITY.md** - internalize security rules
4. **Configure Makefile** for your stack (React/Vue/Node/etc)

### Stage 2: Working with Claude Code

1. **Launch** `claude` in project root
2. **CLAUDE.md auto-loads** into context
3. **Ask AI to read PROJECT_INTAKE.md** and ask questions
4. **Work modularly**: one module ‚Üí testing ‚Üí next module

### Stage 3: Maintenance and Evolution

1. **Update BACKLOG.md** after each sprint
2. **Enhance ARCHITECTURE.md** with architectural decisions
3. **Expand AGENTS.md** with new patterns
4. **Use slash commands** to automate routine tasks

---

## üí° Best Practices

### For PROJECT_INTAKE.md

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Start with "**WHY?**" - problem ‚Üí solution ‚Üí value
- Create 2-3 User Personas with names and pain points
- Describe User Flows step-by-step (not abstractions!)
- Separate features into **unique** (build) vs **standard** (integrate ready-made)
- Plan modular structure

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Leave [FILL IN] without filling
- Write abstractly without specifics
- Plan to build standard features from scratch (Auth, Payments, etc)

### For working with Claude Code

‚úÖ **DO:**
- Use `/commit` instead of manual commits
- Load context via TodoWrite for task tracking
- Work by modules: Auth ‚Üí API ‚Üí Screens ‚Üí Business Logic
- Ask AI to update documentation with changes

‚ùå **DON'T:**
- Don't load entire project into context at once
- Don't skip SECURITY.md
- Don't ignore architectural decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md

### For security

‚úÖ **ALWAYS:**
- Read SECURITY.md before coding
- Use `.env.example` ‚Üí `.env.local`
- Validate all input data
- Use `/security` slash command for audits

‚ùå **NEVER:**
- Commit `.env` files
- Hardcode secrets in code
- Ignore security warnings
