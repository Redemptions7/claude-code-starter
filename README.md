# Claude Code Starter

Ready-to-use meta-documentation framework for structured AI-assisted development with Claude Code.

> **⚠️ Important Note:**
> This framework is designed for **beginners practicing vibe-coding**, not professional developers. It covers a tiny fraction of AI coding agents' capabilities and will evolve and be modified as practical experience accumulates.
>
> **🎓 Created to support students of the AI Agents course for beginners:**
> - Full course: [AI Agents Full Course](https://alexeykrol.com/courses/ai_full/) (Russian)
> - For complete beginners: [Free AI Intro Course](https://alexeykrol.com/courses/ai_intro/) (Russian)

## The Problem & Solution

### The Problem

When working with Claude Code or other AI agents:
- 🔥 AI doesn't understand project context → makes wrong architectural decisions
- 💸 Loads entire project into context → wastes tokens and money
- 🔄 You explain the same things repeatedly → waste time
- 🎲 Unpredictable results → no single source of truth
- 🚫 Security issues → AI doesn't know the rules

### The Solution

The framework provides **14 ready-made documentation templates** that:
- ✅ **Auto-load** into Claude Code context (via `CLAUDE.md`)
- ✅ **Save tokens** through modular architecture
- ✅ **Cold Start Protocol v1.4.0** - 85% token savings (5x cheaper!) on session reloads
- ✅ **PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md** - instant project state overview
- ✅ **Modular focus** - loads only current module
- ✅ **Single source of truth** for AI and team
- ✅ **Built-in security** (SECURITY.md)
- ✅ **Slash commands** for automation (/commit, /pr, /migrate, etc.)
- ✅ **Standardized processes** via Makefile


## 🚀 Installation

1. **Download files** from [Releases](https://github.com/alexeykrol/claude-code-starter/releases):
   - `init-starter.zip` (Russian) or `init-starter-en.zip` (English)
   - `init-project.sh`

2. **Copy both files** to your project folder

3. **Run installation** (open terminal in your project folder):
   ```bash
   bash init-project.sh
   ```

4. **Launch Claude Code:**
   ```bash
   claude
   ```

5. **Exit and restart** (to load slash commands):
   ```bash
   exit
   claude
   ```

6. **Start the framework:**
   ```
   start
   ```

**Done!** AI will analyze your project and guide you through next steps.

## 💰 Token Economics & ROI

### Understanding the Investment

**First-Time Setup (One-Time Cost):**
```
Initial framework read: ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15-0.20)
+ Project setup and template deployment
+ Optional: Legacy project migration
= One-time investment that pays for itself quickly
```

**Every Cold Start After (Ongoing Savings):**
```
Without framework: ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15) per restart
With framework: ~2-3k tokens (~$0.03) per restart
Savings per restart: ~$0.12 (80%!)
```

### ROI Calculation

**30 Cold Starts Per Month (typical for active project):**
```
Without optimization: 30 × $0.15 = $4.50/month
With framework: 30 × $0.03 = $0.90/month
---
Monthly savings: $3.60
Annual savings: $43.20 per project!
```

**Payback Period:** Just 2-3 cold starts! 🚀

**After that:** Pure savings on every session restart.

### Why Modular Focus Matters

The framework's modular approach provides continuous benefits:

✅ **Fewer Tokens** - Load only what you need (Auth module, not entire project)
✅ **Fewer Errors** - AI doesn't get confused in large context
✅ **Faster Responses** - Less to read and analyze
✅ **Better Accuracy** - Focused context = focused answers

**Example:**
- Monolithic: Load entire 5000-line project = ~8k tokens + higher error rate
- Modular: Load Auth module (200 lines) = ~1k tokens + precise answers

The investment pays for itself almost immediately, then continues saving on every session.

## ⚡ Cold Start Protocol: Token Optimization

### Problem: Session Reloads Waste Tokens

Every time Claude Code restarts:
- **Without optimization:** Reads ALL files → ~15-20k tokens (~$0.15-0.20)
- **With basic protocol:** Reads ONLY needed files → ~6-8k tokens (~$0.05-0.08)
- **With PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md + modular focus:** ~2-3k tokens (~$0.02-0.03)
- **Result:** **~85% token savings = 5x cheaper!** 🚀

### How It Works

**Stage 1: PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md - instant start (~500 tokens)**
1. AI reads PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md FIRST
2. Sees: Phase 3 (45%), Auth Module in development
3. Loads ONLY Auth Module from BACKLOG.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
4. **~2-3k tokens instead of ~10k = 75% savings!**

**Stage 2: Modular context loading (~2-3k tokens)**
- Reads ONLY current module from BACKLOG.md
- Reads ONLY module section from ARCHITECTURE.md
- Loads ONLY current module files
- Skips other modules until needed

**Stage 3: Never Unless Asked**
- ❌ Other modules (only on request)
- ❌ MIGRATION_REPORT.md (only if user asks)
- ❌ WORKFLOW.md (only if user asks)
- ❌ archive/* (only on request)

### Automatic After Migration

When you run `/migrate-finalize`:
1. Migration Status automatically set to `✅ COMPLETED (YYYY-MM-DD)`
2. Next session AI sees this status
3. Skips reading migration report
4. **~5k tokens saved on every reload** going forward

**See CLAUDE.md → "🔄 Cold Start Protocol" for full details**

## 🧩 Philosophy: Modular Architecture

### Why modules are critical for AI work?

**Monolithic approach problem:**
```
Claude loads entire project (5000 lines) →
Wastes tokens reading everything →
Expensive and slow →
May get confused in large context
```

**Solution through modules:**
```
Claude loads only needed module (200 lines) →
Fewer tokens →
Faster and cheaper →
Better understanding of task
```

### Modularity Principle

**Application = Set of small LEGO blocks**

Each module:
- Solves **one narrow task**
- Has **clear input and output**
- Can be **tested separately**
- **Doesn't depend** on other modules

## 🎓 How to Work with the Framework

### Working with Claude Code

1. **Launch** `claude` in project root
2. **CLAUDE.md auto-loads** into context
3. **Ask AI to read PROJECT_INTAKE.md** and ask questions
4. **Work modularly**: one module → testing → next module

### Maintenance and Evolution

1. **Update BACKLOG.md** after each sprint
2. **Enhance ARCHITECTURE.md** with architectural decisions
3. **Expand AGENTS.md** with new patterns
4. **Use slash commands** to automate routine tasks

---

## 💡 Best Practices

### For PROJECT_INTAKE.md

✅ **DO:**
- Start with "**WHY?**" - problem → solution → value
- Create 2-3 User Personas with names and pain points
- Describe User Flows step-by-step (not abstractions!)
- Separate features into **unique** (build) vs **standard** (integrate ready-made)
- Plan modular structure

❌ **DON'T:**
- Leave [FILL IN] without filling
- Write abstractly without specifics
- Plan to build standard features from scratch (Auth, Payments, etc)

### For working with Claude Code

✅ **DO:**
- Use `/commit` instead of manual commits
- Load context via TodoWrite for task tracking
- Work by modules: Auth → API → Screens → Business Logic
- Ask AI to update documentation with changes

❌ **DON'T:**
- Don't load entire project into context at once
- Don't skip SECURITY.md
- Don't ignore architectural decisions from ARCHITECTURE.md

### For security

✅ **ALWAYS:**
- Read SECURITY.md before coding
- Use `.env.example` → `.env.local`
- Validate all input data
- Use `/security` slash command for audits

❌ **NEVER:**
- Commit `.env` files
- Hardcode secrets in code
- Ignore security warnings
