## [1.1.3] - 2025-01-11

### Added

#### ðŸ“‚ Migration Exclusion System (.migrationignore)
- **Templates:**
  - `.migrationignore.example` in Init/ (Russian version)
  - `.migrationignore.example` in init_eng/ (English version)

#### Exclusion Features
- **Gitignore-style Syntax:**
  - Folder exclusions: `docs/articles/`, `research/`
  - Pattern matching: `notes/meeting-*.md`, `*-2024-*.md`
  - File extensions: `*.pdf`, `*.docx`, `*.pptx`
  - Negative patterns: `!important.md` (don't exclude)
- **Auto-detection:**
  - AI analyzes files before migration
  - Detects non-meta files (articles, meeting notes, research docs)
  - Offers to create .migrationignore with recommendations
  - User confirms exclusions interactively
- **Smart Exclusion Criteria:**
  - Files in folders: articles/, references/, research/, examples/
  - File patterns: meeting-*.md, brainstorm-*.md, temp-*.md
  - Date patterns: *-2024-*.md, *-2025-*.md
  - Large files (>50KB) with lots of code
  - Old/archived folders: old/, archive/, deprecated/
  - Binary files: *.pdf, *.docx, *.pptx
- **Exclusion Behavior:**
  - Excluded files remain in original location (NOT migrated)
  - Excluded files are NOT archived
  - Excluded files are NOT modified
  - Detailed reporting in MIGRATION_REPORT.md

### Changed
- **Migration Command (`/migrate`):**
  - Added Step 0: Check .migrationignore before scanning
  - Interactive .migrationignore creation if missing
  - Respects exclusion patterns during file scanning
  - Updated Summary section to show excluded file counts
- **MIGRATION_REPORT.md:**
  - Added "Excluded from Migration" section
  - Shows patterns and matched files
  - Explains why files were excluded and where they remain
- **MIGRATION.md** (both languages):
  - Added Step 3.5: "(Optional) Create .migrationignore"
  - Detailed guide on what to exclude vs what to keep
  - Examples and syntax explanation
- **README.md and README_RU.md:**
  - Added "Excluding Files from Migration" section
  - Quick start instructions updated with .migrationignore step
  - Examples of common exclusion patterns
- **CLAUDE.md** (both languages):
  - Updated migration references to mention .migrationignore

### Why This Matters
Solves a critical pain point: legacy projects often contain reference materials, meeting notes, and research documents that are NOT project meta-documentation. Without exclusion mechanism, these files would:
- Be incorrectly analyzed as project documentation
- Create false conflicts during migration
- Clutter Init/ with non-project information
- Waste time on manual cleanup

**User Experience:**
- Before: All files processed â†’ many false conflicts â†’ confusion â†’ manual cleanup needed
- After: Create .migrationignore â†’ only project docs processed â†’ clean migration â†’ no cleanup

**Smart Defaults:**
AI automatically suggests exclusions based on file analysis, making the process effortless for users who don't know what to exclude.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-01-11

### Added

#### ðŸ¤– Interactive Conflict Resolution Command
- **Slash Command:**
  - `/migrate-resolve` - Interactive AI-guided conflict resolution for migration

#### Resolution Features
- **Interactive Process:**
  - Reads each conflict from CONFLICTS.md one by one
  - AI analyzes both legacy and Init/ files
  - Proposes smart merge solution for each conflict
  - User chooses: [A]uto-resolve / [M]anual / [S]kip / [Q]uit
- **Smart Merge Strategy:**
  - AI provides concrete step-by-step solution
  - Specifies exact sections to copy and where to insert
  - Transforms legacy content to framework format
  - Preserves important information
- **Safety Features:**
  - Creates timestamped backups in `.conflict_resolution_backup/`
  - Detailed logging in `CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md`
  - Requires confirmation before applying each change
  - Legacy files never modified (read-only)
  - Can quit anytime and resume later
- **Rollback Support:**
  - `/migrate-rollback --conflicts-only` for conflict resolution rollback
  - Manual rollback from timestamped backups
  - No changes to main migration

#### Conflict Resolution Logging
- **CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_LOG.md:**
  - Session information with timestamps
  - Detailed action logs for each conflict
  - AI recommendations for manual conflicts
  - Statistics and status tracking

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` (both languages) with `/migrate-resolve` command reference
- Updated `MIGRATION.md` (both languages):
  - Added "Automatic Resolution via /migrate-resolve" section
  - Updated "Troubleshooting" with /migrate-resolve examples
- Updated `README.md` and `README_RU.md` with conflict resolution mention

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive command guide in `.claude/commands/migrate-resolve.md` (Russian & English)
- Examples of conflict resolution scenarios
- Integration guide with other migration commands

### Why This Matters
Eliminates the main pain point of migration - manual conflict resolution. Users no longer need to figure out how to merge legacy docs into framework structure. AI guides them through each conflict with concrete, actionable solutions.

**User Experience:**
- Before: "Too many conflicts, don't know where to start" â†’ frustration â†’ abandoned migration
- After: `/migrate-resolve` â†’ AI shows exactly what to do â†’ [A] to accept â†’ done!

## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-11

### Added

#### ðŸ”„ Migration Rollback Command
- **Slash Command:**
  - `/migrate-rollback` - Rollback migration at any stage (before or after finalization)

#### Rollback Features
- **Automatic Status Detection:**
  - Detects whether migration is before or after finalization
  - Different rollback strategies for each status
- **Safety Features:**
  - Creates backup copy in `.rollback_backup/`
  - Asks for confirmation before destructive actions
  - Can be interrupted at any stage
- **Two Rollback Scenarios:**
  - **Before finalization**: Quick rollback (delete Init/, restore from archive/)
  - **After finalization**: Git-aware rollback (revert commit, restore files)
- **Restoration:**
  - Restores all legacy files from archive/
  - Deletes or restores Init/ to pre-migration state
  - Cleans up migration reports

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` (both languages) with `/migrate-rollback` command reference
- Updated `MIGRATION.md` (both languages) with rollback section
- Updated README files with rollback safety note

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive rollback guide in `.claude/commands/migrate-rollback.md`
- Updated "Troubleshooting" section in MIGRATION.md to reference `/migrate-rollback`
- Examples of rollback scenarios and safety checks

### Why This Matters
Provides safe exit strategy from migration at any point, increasing confidence when trying the framework on existing projects.
