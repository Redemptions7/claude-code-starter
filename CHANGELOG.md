## [1.1.1] - 2025-01-11

### Added

#### ðŸ”„ Migration Rollback Command
- **Slash Command:**
  - `/migrate-rollback` - Rollback migration at any stage (before or after finalization)

#### Rollback Features
- **Automatic Status Detection:**
  - Detects whether migration is before or after finalization
  - Different rollback strategies for each status
- **Safety Features:**
  - Creates backup copy in `.rollback_backup/`
  - Asks for confirmation before destructive actions
  - Can be interrupted at any stage
- **Two Rollback Scenarios:**
  - **Before finalization**: Quick rollback (delete Init/, restore from archive/)
  - **After finalization**: Git-aware rollback (revert commit, restore files)
- **Restoration:**
  - Restores all legacy files from archive/
  - Deletes or restores Init/ to pre-migration state
  - Cleans up migration reports

### Changed
- Updated `CLAUDE.md` (both languages) with `/migrate-rollback` command reference
- Updated `MIGRATION.md` (both languages) with rollback section
- Updated README files with rollback safety note

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive rollback guide in `.claude/commands/migrate-rollback.md`
- Updated "Troubleshooting" section in MIGRATION.md to reference `/migrate-rollback`
- Examples of rollback scenarios and safety checks

### Why This Matters
Provides safe exit strategy from migration at any point, increasing confidence when trying the framework on existing projects.
