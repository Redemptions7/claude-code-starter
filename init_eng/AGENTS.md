# AI Agent Instructions

**Project:** [PROJECT_NAME]
**Purpose:** Meta-instructions for effective AI-assisted development
**Created:** [DATE]
**Last Updated:** [DATE]

> **Note:** This file is optimized for AI assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) working with this codebase.

---

## üéØ Quick Start for AI Agents

### Required Reading (in order):
1. **SECURITY.md** - Security requirements and practices (READ FIRST!)
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - System architecture and technical decisions
3. **BACKLOG.md** - Current implementation status and roadmap (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
4. **README.md** - User-facing project information
5. **WORKFLOW.md** - Development processes and sprint workflow

### ‚ö†Ô∏è SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH:
**BACKLOG.md** is the ONLY authoritative source for:
- Current implementation status
- Feature priorities
- Development roadmap

### Key Files Quick Reference:
```bash
# Architecture & Planning
ARCHITECTURE.md                # System design and patterns
BACKLOG.md                     # Implementation status (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
WORKFLOW.md                    # Development processes
README.md                      # User-facing documentation
CLAUDE.md                      # Auto-loaded context for Claude Code

# Core Application
[FILL IN: main project files]
# Example:
# src/store/useStore.ts        # State management
# src/lib/api.ts               # API service
# src/components/Main.tsx      # Main component

# Configuration
Makefile                       # Standard commands (make dev, make build, etc)
.env.example                   # Environment variables template
.claude/commands/              # Custom slash commands for Claude Code
.claude/settings.json          # Claude Code permissions
.claudeignore                  # Files to ignore in AI context
```

### üì¶ Standard Commands (Makefile):
The project uses Makefile to standardize commands:

```bash
# Development
make dev          # Start development server
make build        # Build for production
make start        # Start production server

# Quality Checks
make lint         # Run code linter
make fix-lint     # Auto-fix linter issues
make typecheck    # Check TypeScript types
make test         # Run tests
make test-watch   # Tests in watch mode

# Security & Dependencies
make security     # npm audit check
make security-fix # Auto-fix vulnerabilities
make audit        # Full check (lint+typecheck+test+security)

# Database (when used)
make db-migrate   # Apply database migrations
make db-reset     # Reset database
make db-seed      # Seed with test data

# Utility
make install      # Install dependencies
make clean        # Clean build artifacts
make reinstall    # Reinstall dependencies
make doctor       # Diagnose environment
make help         # Show all commands

# Pre-commit/push checks
make pre-commit   # lint + typecheck
make pre-push     # audit + build
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `make <command>` instead of direct `npm run <command>`
- Makefile controls what exactly gets executed
- Easier for Claude Code to automate (via .claude/settings.json)
- Consistent commands across projects

## üö´ NEVER DO

### Code & Architecture
- ‚ùå **[FILL IN: project-specific rules]**
- ‚ùå **Update database structure** without migration script
- ‚ùå **Use `any` type** without explicit justification (TypeScript projects)
- ‚ùå **Create multiple components in one file** (if using component approach)
- ‚ùå **Duplicate API calls** (especially in polling loops)
- ‚ùå **Ignore security best practices** (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF)

### Process & Documentation
- ‚ùå **Skip documentation updates** after sprint completion
- ‚ùå **Modify BACKLOG.md** without completing actual implementation
- ‚ùå **Create commits** without meaningful messages
- ‚ùå **Update dependencies** without testing
- ‚ùå **Push to main/master** without review (if team workflow requires it)

### üîê Security (CRITICAL - READ SECURITY.md FIRST!)

**üìñ FULL SECURITY POLICY:** SECURITY.md

**BEFORE starting any coding task:**
1. Read SECURITY.md ‚Üí Stage 1 (Planning)
2. Follow checklists for current stage
3. If in doubt ‚Üí `/security` for audit

**Key principles (all details in SECURITY.md):**
- üîê Secrets management ‚Üí SECURITY.md "Environment Variables"
- üîê Input validation ‚Üí SECURITY.md Stage 3
- üîê SQL injection prevention ‚Üí SECURITY.md "Database Security"
- üîê XSS prevention ‚Üí SECURITY.md "Output Sanitization"

**AGENTS.md contains only project-specific security patterns!**
See "Project Security Patterns" section below for project-specific rules.

---

## ‚úÖ ALWAYS DO

### Before Making Changes
- ‚úÖ **Read ARCHITECTURE.md** for architectural decisions
- ‚úÖ **Check BACKLOG.md** for current status
- ‚úÖ **Review related documentation** before making changes
- ‚úÖ **Test in development** environment first

### During Development
- ‚úÖ **Use existing patterns** from codebase
- ‚úÖ **Follow TypeScript strict mode** (type everything properly)
- ‚úÖ **Write migration scripts** for database changes
- ‚úÖ **Update types** after schema changes
- ‚úÖ **Test thoroughly** before marking tasks as complete
- ‚úÖ **Use TodoWrite tool** to track progress

### üîê Security (Every Single Time)

**üìñ USE CHECKLISTS FROM SECURITY.md:**
- See SECURITY.md ‚Üí Stage-specific checklists
- See SECURITY.md ‚Üí "Security Requirements by Stage"

**Quick check:**
```bash
/security  # Run AI-guided security audit
make security  # npm audit check
```

### After Completion
- ‚úÖ **Update BACKLOG.md** with implementation status
- ‚úÖ **Update ARCHITECTURE.md** if architectural changes made
- ‚úÖ **Update AGENTS.md** if new patterns/rules discovered
- ‚úÖ **Update README.md** if user-facing changes
- ‚úÖ **Create meaningful git commit** (see WORKFLOW.md for template)
- ‚úÖ **Mark all TodoWrite tasks** as completed

## üöÄ Release Management (for claude-code-starter project)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** This section applies **ONLY to the claude-code-starter project**
> DO NOT apply these rules to user projects!

### Proactive Release Checking

**Context:** When working with the `claude-code-starter` framework (path `/Users/alexeykrolmini/Downloads/Code/Project_init`), you MUST automatically offer creating a release after substantial changes.

**Why this matters:**
```
The framework's purpose is helping other projects not miss anything.
We ourselves shouldn't forget to update README and CHANGELOG!
("Shoemaker without shoes" problem)
```

### Definition of "Substantial Changes"

**Substantial changes include:**

1. **New features:**
   - New slash commands added to `.claude/commands/`
   - New sections in templates (Init/, init_eng/)
   - New protocols (e.g., Cold Start Protocol)
   - New documentation files

2. **Bug fixes:**
   - Critical errors fixed in commands
   - Migration logic errors fixed
   - Template errors fixed

3. **Documentation improvements:**
   - Substantial sections added to README
   - New best practices added
   - Usage examples added

**NOT substantial:**
- Typos
- Formatting without content changes
- Code comments
- Minor text edits

### Proactive Suggestion Rules

**After committing substantial changes:**

1. **Analyze recent commits:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -n 5
   ```

2. **Assess significance:**
   - IF new files in .claude/commands/ ‚Üí Substantial
   - IF changes in Init/ templates ‚Üí Substantial
   - IF new sections in README ‚Üí Substantial
   - IF bugfixes in commands ‚Üí Substantial

3. **Automatically suggest release:**
   ```
   ‚úÖ Changes committed.

   üéØ Substantial changes detected:
   - [list of changes]

   üí° Recommended to create release to update CHANGELOG and README.

   Create release?
   1. Patch (X.X.N) - bugfixes, documentation
   2. Minor (X.N.0) - new features
   3. Major (N.0.0) - breaking changes

   Choose [1/2/3] or "skip":
   ```

4. **IF user chose 1/2/3:**
   - Run `/release` automatically
   - Pass selected release type

5. **IF user chose "skip":**
   - Don't suggest again in this session
   - But suggest again in next session if release not created

### Slash Command `/release`

**Purpose:** Automates release process

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes changes since last release
2. Determines release type (patch/minor/major)
3. Updates version in README.md and README_RU.md
4. Creates CHANGELOG.md entry
5. Rebuilds zip archives (init-starter.zip, init-starter-en.zip)
6. Creates release commit
7. Pushes to GitHub
8. Optionally creates GitHub Release

**Usage:**
```bash
/release
```

**When to use:**
- After completing new feature
- After fixing critical bug
- After substantial documentation changes
- Before announcing updates

### Release Check On "Cold Start"

**On session reload (Cold Start):**

1. **Read first 20 lines of README.md**
   ```bash
   head -n 20 README.md
   ```

2. **Extract current version:**
   ```markdown
   [![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.2.5-orange.svg)]
   ```

3. **Check last commit:**
   ```bash
   git log -1 --oneline
   ```

4. **IF last commit NOT "chore: Release v..." AND there are new commits:**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline --grep="chore: Release" -1  # last release
   git log <last-release>..HEAD --oneline        # commits after release
   ```

5. **IF substantial changes found without release:**
   - Suggest creating release (see template above)
   - BUT only once, not on every message

### Integration with TodoWrite

**If working on feature/bugfix:**

1. Add to todo list:
   ```
   - Implement feature X
   - Test feature X
   - Update documentation
   - Create release  # ‚Üê Add automatically for substantial changes
   ```

2. After completing all tasks ‚Üí automatically suggest `/release`

### Examples

**Example 1: New command added**
```
‚úÖ New slash command /release created

üéØ This is substantial change:
- Added Init/.claude/commands/release.md
- Added init_eng/.claude/commands/release.md
- Updated AGENTS.md and WORKFLOW.md

üí° Recommended to create Minor release (new feature).

Create release 1.3.0? [y/n]
```

**Example 2: Critical bugfix**
```
‚úÖ Critical error in /migrate command fixed

üéØ This is substantial change:
- Fixed 8 bugs in migrate.md
- Updated archiving logic

üí° Recommended to create Patch release.

Create release 1.2.6? [y/n]
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: After EVERY Commit

**MANDATORY after creating ANY commit:**

1. **Check README.md and README_RU.md:**
   - [ ] Features list reflects changes
   - [ ] Template count is accurate (e.g., "14 templates" if added 3 files)
   - [ ] Version badge is current (if release)
   - [ ] Cold Start Protocol description is accurate (% token savings)
   - [ ] "What's in Init/" table contains all new files

2. **Check CHANGELOG.md:**
   - [ ] Entry added for current version
   - [ ] All substantial changes described
   - [ ] Number of changed lines/files indicated
   - [ ] "Why This Matters" section added

**Why this is CRITICAL:**
```
The framework's purpose is helping other projects not miss anything.
We ourselves MUST NOT forget to update README and CHANGELOG!
("Shoemaker without shoes" problem v2.0)
```

**Example of what we forgot in v1.4.0:**
- ‚ùå README said "11 templates" instead of "14 templates"
- ‚ùå Features list said "60% savings" instead of "85% savings (5x cheaper!)"
- ‚ùå Didn't mention PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md and modular focus in features

**How to check:**
```bash
# After each commit:
git diff HEAD~1 README.md       # Check README was updated
git diff HEAD~1 CHANGELOG.md    # Check CHANGELOG was updated
```

**Rule for AI:**
After EVERY commit AI MUST:
1. Read README.md (features section, file count)
2. Read CHANGELOG.md (latest version)
3. Verify consistency with commit
4. If inconsistent ‚Üí fix immediately

---

### Checklist Before Release

Before running `/release` ensure:
- [ ] All changes committed
- [ ] Working directory clean
- [ ] New features tested
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] **README.md and CHANGELOG.md verified (see above)**
- [ ] No git conflicts

## üîç Debugging Quick Reference

### [FILL IN: Project-specific debugging commands]

```bash
# Database debugging
[commands to check DB]

# API debugging
[commands to check API]

# State debugging
[commands to check state]
```

**API Optimization:**
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]

**Database Performance:**
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]

**Frontend Performance:**
- [Rule 1]
- [Rule 2]

---

## üöÄ Code Templates

### [FILL IN: Project code templates]

#### New Component Template
```typescript
// Component template example
```

#### New API Route Template
```typescript
// API route template example
```

#### New Service Method Template

// Service method template example
```

---

## üìù Sprint Workflow

See **WORKFLOW.md** for detailed sprint processes, including:
- Sprint structure and phases
- Completion checklists
- Commit message templates
- Documentation update requirements

**Key Rule:** NEVER end a sprint without updating all relevant documentation files.

---

## üìã Where to Get Checklists and Tasks

**CRITICAL for AI:**

**When user asks:**
- "Show me checklist for current phase"
- "What's left to do?"
- "What are the tasks in Sprint 1?"
- "Give me work plan"

**‚úÖ CORRECT:**
1. Read **BACKLOG.md** ‚Üí detailed plan with checklists is there
2. Show statuses: ‚úÖ DONE / üöß IN PROGRESS / ‚è≥ TODO
3. BACKLOG.md = single source of truth for tasks
4. If architectural reference needed ‚Üí then ARCHITECTURE.md

**‚ùå WRONG:**
- ‚ùå Don't read ARCHITECTURE.md for operational checklists
- ‚ùå ARCHITECTURE.md = reference about WHY (technologies, principles), not about WHAT to do now
- ‚ùå Don't generate checklist "from scratch" if BACKLOG.md exists
- ‚ùå Don't try to extract tasks from "Phase 1, Phase 2" sections in ARCHITECTURE.md

**Why this matters:**
If detailed tasks are stored in ARCHITECTURE.md, AI may skip nested items
due to large file size. BACKLOG.md = structured task list, AI reads all items.

**Example of correct response:**
```
User: "Show what's left to do in Sprint 1"

AI Response:
1. ‚úÖ Reading BACKLOG.md...
2. Show "Sprint 1" section with checklists
3. Explain status of each task
4. If implementation details needed ‚Üí check ARCHITECTURE.md
```

**Exception:**
If BACKLOG.md is empty/not filled ‚Üí can use general plan
from ARCHITECTURE.md as fallback, but suggest user to create BACKLOG.md
with detailed tasks.
