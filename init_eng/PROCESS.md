## üìã Template for Post-Phase Update

```markdown
## After completing Phase X:

### BACKLOG.md:
- Mark Phase X as ‚úÖ
- Recalculate progress: Y% (completed/total stages)

### PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md:
- Date: [current date]
- Phase X: ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- Overall progress: Y%
- Project structure: add new files
- Completed tasks: list from Phase X
- Next stage: description of Phase X+1

### CLAUDE.md:
- Current state: add completed tasks from Phase X
- Next step: Phase X+1

### Git:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: complete Phase X - [brief description]"
```

## üéØ Phase Completion Criteria

A phase is considered complete when:

1. ‚úÖ All tasks from BACKLOG.md for this phase are done
2. ‚úÖ Code compiles without errors (`npm run build` or equivalent)
3. ‚úÖ Module/component is tested (manually or automatically)
4. ‚úÖ No critical bugs or TODOs in code
5. ‚úÖ Meta-files are updated (BACKLOG, SNAPSHOT, CLAUDE)

## üìù üö®üö®üö® CRITICAL FOR AI ASSISTANT üö®üö®üö®

> **For AI agents:** Read this BEFORE completing any phase/sprint!

### üéØ Trigger: When to read this checklist?

**MANDATORY to read when:**
- ‚úÖ Last task of phase completed (TodoWrite ‚Üí completed)
- ‚úÖ User says "done", "finishing", "let's wrap up"
- ‚úÖ You're about to say "all tasks completed"
- ‚úÖ Planning to end the session

**‚ö†Ô∏è EVEN IF user doesn't remind - YOU MUST DO THIS YOURSELF!**

---

### After completing each phase:

1. **DO NOT PROCEED TO NEXT PHASE** without updating meta-files
2. **ALWAYS ASK** user: "Phase completed. Update meta-files before next phase?"
3. **USE THE CHECKLIST** above to verify all updates

### Automatic Reminder:

When last task of phase is marked as completed in TodoWrite:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION: Phase completed!
üìã Meta-files need updating:
   1. BACKLOG.md ‚Äî mark phase ‚úÖ, recalculate progress
   2. PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md ‚Äî update status, structure, tasks
   3. CLAUDE.md ‚Äî update current state

‚ùì Update meta-files now? (Recommended YES)
```

### AI Action Sequence:

1. ‚úÖ Completed task ‚Üí TodoWrite marked as completed
2. ‚úÖ Checked: is this the last task of phase?
3. ‚úÖ If YES ‚Üí show reminder above
4. ‚úÖ Ask user
5. ‚úÖ After approval ‚Üí update BACKLOG, SNAPSHOT, CLAUDE
6. ‚úÖ Suggest git commit
7. ‚úÖ ONLY THEN ‚Üí proceed to next phase

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: After EVERY Commit (for claude-code-starter framework)

> **Applies ONLY to the claude-code-starter project!**
> DO NOT apply to user projects!

**MANDATORY after creating ANY commit in claude-code-starter:**

### 1. Check README.md and README_RU.md:
- [ ] Features list reflects changes
- [ ] Template count is accurate (e.g., "14 templates" if added 3 files)
- [ ] Version badge is current (if release)
- [ ] Cold Start Protocol description is accurate (% token savings)
- [ ] "What's in Init/" table contains all new files

### 2. Check CHANGELOG.md:
- [ ] Entry added for current version
- [ ] All substantial changes described
- [ ] Number of changed lines/files indicated
- [ ] "Why This Matters" section added

### Why this is CRITICAL:
```
The framework's purpose is helping other projects not miss anything.
We ourselves MUST NOT forget to update README and CHANGELOG!
("Shoemaker without shoes" problem v2.0)
```

### Rule for AI:
After EVERY commit in claude-code-starter AI MUST:
1. Read README.md (features section, file count)
2. Read CHANGELOG.md (latest version)
3. Verify consistency with commit
4. If inconsistent ‚Üí fix immediately

**Instructions:** See AGENTS.md ‚Üí "Release Management" ‚Üí "CRITICAL: After EVERY Commit"

## üîß How to Use This File

### For AI Assistant:

- **Read this file** when starting new session (part of Cold Start Protocol)
- **Follow the checklist** after each phase
- **Don't forget to update meta-files** before moving to next phase

### For Developer:

- **Verify** that AI updated all files after phase
- **Request meta-file update** if AI forgot
- **Use as checklist** for self-updates

---

## üìä Meta-Files Update Log

### Entry Template:

```markdown
### Phase X: [Phase Name] (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ‚úÖ BACKLOG.md updated
- ‚úÖ PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md updated
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md updated
- ‚úÖ Progress: X% (Y/Z stages)
- ‚úÖ Commit: feat: complete Phase X
```

### Example:

```markdown
### Phase 1: Foundation (2025-10-13)
- ‚úÖ BACKLOG.md updated
- ‚úÖ PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md created
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md updated
- ‚úÖ Progress: 10% (1/10 stages)
- ‚úÖ Commit: feat: complete Phase 1 - project foundation
```

---

## üéì Best Practices

1. **Update meta-files immediately after phase completion**, don't postpone
2. **Check progress percentage** ‚Äî it should grow after each phase
3. **Cross-reference with completed tasks list** in BACKLOG.md
4. **Commit after updating meta-files** to record progress
5. **Ask user for confirmation** before proceeding to next phase

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå What NOT to do:

- Proceed to next phase without updating meta-files
- Forget to recalculate progress
- Not update PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md (most important for Cold Start!)
- Update only one file (need all three: BACKLOG, SNAPSHOT, CLAUDE)

### ‚úÖ What to do:

- Follow checklist sequentially
- Update ALL three files
- Ask user before proceeding
- Commit changes
