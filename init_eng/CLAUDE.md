# Project Context for Claude Code

> This file is automatically loaded into the context of each Claude Code session

## üöÄ Quick Start

### First things to read:
1. **PROJECT_INTAKE.md** - ‚≠ê START HERE - project requirements (v2.0 with User Personas, User Flows, modularity)
2. **SECURITY.md** - üîê CRITICAL - read before any coding!
3. **ARCHITECTURE.md** - system architecture (enriched with modularity philosophy)
4. **BACKLOG.md** - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for project status
5. **AGENTS.md** - detailed instructions for AI

### Important sections in PROJECT_INTAKE.md:
- **Problem ‚Üí Solution ‚Üí Value** - understanding the "why"
- **User Personas** - user portraits for empathy
- **User Flows** - step-by-step interaction scenarios
- **Unique vs Standard Features** - what to build vs what to use off-the-shelf
- **Modular Structure** - critical for token economy and cost savings!

## üì¶ Bash Commands

### Main commands via Makefile:
```bash
make dev          # Start development server
make build        # Build project for production
make test         # Run tests
make lint         # Check code with linter
make typecheck    # TypeScript type checking
make security     # Check npm audit
```

### Git commands:
```bash
git status                    # Check status
git diff                      # View changes
git log --oneline -n 10       # Last 10 commits
gh pr create                  # Create Pull Request
gh issue view <number>        # View issue
```

---

## üé® Code Style

### TypeScript/JavaScript:
- Use ES modules (import/export), not CommonJS (require)
- Destructure imports where possible: `import { foo } from 'bar'`
- Type everything strictly, avoid `any`
- Use functional style where appropriate

### Naming:
- camelCase for variables and functions
- PascalCase for components and classes
- UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
- Descriptive names (no abbreviations)

### File Structure:
- One component = one file
- Group related files in folders
- index.ts for folder exports

---

## üîê Security (CRITICAL!)

**ALWAYS before coding:**
- ‚úÖ Read SECURITY.md
- ‚úÖ Validate ALL user input
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for secrets
- ‚úÖ Use parameterized queries (not concatenation)
- ‚úÖ Check authentication and authorization
- ‚ùå NEVER hardcode secrets
- ‚ùå NEVER commit .env files
- ‚ùå NEVER use eval() or new Function()

---

## üèóÔ∏è Workflow

### Before starting a task:
1. Read ARCHITECTURE.md (architectural decisions)
2. Check BACKLOG.md (current status)
3. Use TodoWrite for planning
4. Follow existing patterns from code

### After series of changes:
- Always run `make typecheck` (or npm run type-check)
- Run `make lint` for style checking
- For speed, run individual tests, not all at once

### Working with git:
- Use meaningful commit messages (why, not what)
- Merge: for feature branches to main
- Rebase: for updating feature branch from main
- Always check git status before commit

### Sprint completion:
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update BACKLOG.md (implementation status)
3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md (if architectural changes were made)
4. Update README.md (if user-facing changes)
5. Update AGENTS.md (if new patterns/rules)
6. Create sprint completion commit

## üîß Environment Setup

### Node.js and packages:
- Node.js version: 18+ (check with `node --version`)
- Package manager: npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- After git pull always: `npm install`

### Environment Variables:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
- NEVER commit `.env` or `.env.local`
- All secrets only in .env, not in code!

### IDE settings:
- Recommended: VS Code or similar
- TypeScript: strict mode enabled
- ESLint: autofix on save
- Prettier: format on save

---

## üìã Important Details

### Database:
- [FILL IN: DB type, ORM, important details]
- Use migrations for schema changes
- Update TypeScript types after schema changes

### API:
- [FILL IN: REST/GraphQL/tRPC, important details]
- Always validate input data on server
- Use correct HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)

### State Management:
- [FILL IN: Redux/Zustand/Context, important details]
- Follow established patterns
- Don't duplicate state

---

## üêõ Debugging

### Common problems:

**Problem:** TypeScript errors after git pull
**Solution:**
```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
```

**Problem:** Build fails
**Solution:**
```bash
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

**Problem:** Environment variables not working
**Solution:**
- Check that .env.local exists
- Restart dev server
- Check that variables start with NEXT_PUBLIC_ (for client)

---

## üéØ Priorities

1. **Security** - always first
2. **Documentation** - update every sprint
3. **Tests** - write tests for critical logic
4. **Performance** - optimize bottlenecks
5. **UX** - think about the user

---

## üìù Slash Commands (Custom Commands)

Use slash commands for typical tasks:

- `/security` - conduct security audit
- `/test` - write tests
- `/feature` - plan new feature
- `/review` - conduct code review
- `/optimize` - optimize performance
- `/refactor` - conduct refactoring
- `/explain` - explain code
- `/fix` - find and fix bug
- `/commit` - create git commit
- `/pr` - create Pull Request
- `/migrate` - create database migration

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- DON'T delete existing functionality without explicit instruction
- DON'T change architectural decisions without discussion
- DON'T commit commented code (delete it)
- DON'T duplicate code - use functions/components
- DON'T ignore TypeScript errors - fix them

---

## üîÑ Integrations

### GitHub:
- Use `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- Issues, PRs, comments - all through gh
- Automate routine with gh

### MCP servers:
- [FILL IN: list of installed MCP servers]
- Use MCP for extended functionality
