---

Help me plan and implement a new feature in the project.

**Steps:**

1. **Requirements analysis:**
   - What exactly needs to be implemented?
   - What are the edge cases?
   - How does this fit into existing architecture?

2. **Planning:**
   - What components need to be created/modified?
   - What API endpoints or Server Actions are needed?
   - Are database changes needed?
   - What dependencies will be required?

3. **Security:**
   - What security risks?
   - What needs validation?
   - How to check authorization?

4. **Break down into tasks:**
   - Break implementation into small steps
   - Define execution order
   - Estimate complexity of each step

5. **Implementation:**
   - Create necessary files
   - Follow coding standards
   - Add comments
   - Check TypeScript types

6. **Testing:**
   - How to test the feature?
   - What edge cases to check?

**Principles:**
- Follow project architecture (.claude/architecture.md)
- Follow coding standards (.claude/coding-standards.md)
- Security above all
- Code should be clear and maintainable
