Help refactor code while preserving functionality and improving quality.

**Refactoring goals:**

1. **Improve readability:**
   - Clear names
   - Break up large functions
   - Remove duplication
   - Add comments

2. **Performance:**
   - Optimize rendering
   - Memoization
   - Lazy loading
   - Optimize DB queries

3. **Type safety:**
   - Strict typing
   - Remove `any`
   - Proper interfaces

4. **Architecture:**
   - Proper separation of concerns
   - Extract reusable logic
   - Follow project patterns

**Process:**

1. **Analysis:**
   - What can be improved?
   - What problems exist?
   - Where is duplication?

2. **Plan:**
   - Define refactoring steps
   - Start small
   - Check after each step

3. **Refactoring:**
   - Preserve functionality
   - Follow coding standards
   - Improve gradually

4. **Verification:**
   - Tests pass (if exist)
   - TypeScript no errors
   - Linter satisfied
   - Functionality unchanged

**Principles:**
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
- Single Responsibility Principle

**Refactoring examples:**
- Extract custom hooks
- Create reusable components
- Simplify conditional logic
- Optimize queries
