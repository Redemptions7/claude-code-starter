Help me find and fix a bug in the project.

**Debugging process:**

1. **Gather information:**
   - What is the expected behavior?
   - What actually happens?
   - Are there errors in console?
   - When does the problem occur?
   - Can it be reproduced?

2. **Code analysis:**
   - Study related files
   - Check recent changes
   - Find potential causes

3. **Hypotheses:**
   - Suggest possible bug causes
   - Prioritize by probability

4. **Verification:**
   - Add logging if needed
   - Check data in DB
   - Test hypotheses

5. **Fix:**
   - Suggest solution
   - Explain why it works
   - Ensure no side effects

6. **Prevention:**
   - How to prevent this in future?
   - Is validation needed?
   - Should we add a test?

**Common problems:**

- Missing validation
- Authorization issues
- Race conditions
- Incorrect typing
- Errors in async/await
- Caching problems

If the problem is unclear, check `.claude/troubleshooting.md` for common solutions.
