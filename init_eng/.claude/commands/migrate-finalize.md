# Finalize Project Migration

> Use this command to complete migration after reviewing and resolving all conflicts

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT

This command performs **Stage 2** (finalization).
Before running, ensure:
- ‚úÖ Read MIGRATION_REPORT.md
- ‚úÖ Resolved all critical conflicts from CONFLICTS.md
- ‚úÖ Checked all init_eng/ files for completeness
- ‚úÖ Filled sections marked [NEEDS FILLING]

---

## üìã Finalization Process (Stage 2)

### Step 1: Pre-checks

Before finalization, verify:

```bash
# Check required files exist
ls -la MIGRATION_REPORT.md
ls -la archive/

# Check init_eng/ files
ls -la init_eng/
```

**Required conditions:**
- [ ] MIGRATION_REPORT.md exists
- [ ] archive/ created and contains legacy files
- [ ] init_eng/ files filled
- [ ] Conflicts resolved (CONFLICTS.md deleted or empty)

### Step 2: Check Critical Files

Read and verify:

#### SECURITY.md
- [ ] Doesn't contain [CRITICAL: NEEDS FILLING]
- [ ] All sections filled
- [ ] Security practices documented

**If SECURITY.md not filled:**
```
üî¥ CRITICAL ERROR:
SECURITY.md must be fully filled before finalization.
This is not optional!

Actions:
1. Fill all SECURITY.md sections
2. Run /security for audit
3. Return to /migrate-finalize
```

#### PROJECT_INTAKE.md
- [ ] Problem/Solution/Value filled
- [ ] User Personas created (minimum 1)
- [ ] User Flows described
- [ ] Features listed
- [ ] Modular Structure planned

**If critical sections not filled:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING:
PROJECT_INTAKE.md contains unfilled critical sections.
Recommended to fill before finalization.

Continue? (y/n)
```

#### ARCHITECTURE.md
- [ ] Tech Stack current
- [ ] Folder Structure reflects reality
- [ ] Module Architecture planned
- [ ] Key Decisions documented

#### BACKLOG.md
- [ ] Task statuses current
- [ ] Priorities set

### Step 3: Check Conflicts

```bash
# Check if CONFLICTS.md exists
if [ -f "CONFLICTS.md" ]; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICTS.md still exists"
  echo "Read it and ensure all conflicts resolved"
fi
```

**If CONFLICTS.md exists:**
1. Read file
2. Verify all critical (üî¥) conflicts resolved
3. Ask user: "All conflicts resolved? (y/n)"
4. If yes - continue
5. If no - stop and ask to resolve

### Step 4: Finalize Documents

#### Move MIGRATION_REPORT.md to archive/

```bash
# Add final section to MIGRATION_REPORT.md
cat >> MIGRATION_REPORT.md << 'EOF'

---

## ‚úÖ Migration Finalized

**Date:** [DATE]
**Status:** COMPLETE

### Final Actions:

### Step 5: Update CLAUDE.md

Add migration section at the beginning of CLAUDE.md:

```markdown

- ‚úÖ CONFLICTS.md processed (if existed)
- ‚úÖ CLAUDE.md updated with migration notice
- ‚úÖ BACKLOG.md updated
- ‚úÖ Git commit created

üìÇ Project Structure:

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/                     # Code unchanged

üéØ What's Next:

1. **Read updated CLAUDE.md**
   - It's now your main guide
   - Contains migration notice

2. **Use init_eng/ as single source of truth**
   - PROJECT_INTAKE.md - for requirements
   - ARCHITECTURE.md - for architecture
   - BACKLOG.md - for task status
   - SECURITY.md - for security

3. **archive/ for reference only**
   - DON'T update files in archive/
   - Refer to only when necessary

4. **Update documentation with changes**
   - After each sprint update BACKLOG.md
   - With architectural changes update ARCHITECTURE.md
   - With new patterns update AGENTS.md

5. **Use slash commands**
   - /commit - for commits
   - /pr - for Pull Requests
   - /security - for security audits
   - /feature - for new features
   - /db-migrate - for database migrations

üìö Useful Commands:

# View migration report
cat archive/MIGRATION_REPORT.md

# Check init_eng/ structure
ls -la init_eng/

# Start working with framework
claude

üí° Recommendations:

1. **Introduce team to new structure**
   - Show where to find information now
   - Explain that init_eng/ is single source of truth

2. **Update CI/CD if needed**
   - If CI/CD referenced old files - update paths

3. **Review documentation**
   - In a week check everyone uses new structure
   - Supplement documentation as needed
